# Adaptive RL Agent for Dynamic Resource Allocation

## Overview
Designed and implemented a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent (DQN) to optimize resource allocation in complex, simulated dynamic environments. The agent learns adaptive policies to maximize operational efficiency under fluctuating demands and constraints.

## Key Features
Developed using Python with PyTorch for neural network implementation and OpenAI Gym for environment simulation. Employed NumPy for efficient numerical computation and data handling during training and evaluation.
