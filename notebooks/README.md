2. **environment_exploration.ipynb** - Environment behavior analysis and visualization
3. **hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb** - Systematic hyperparameter exploration
4. **xai_analysis.ipynb** - Explainable AI analysis of agent decisions

## Usage:

1. Install Jupyter: `pip install jupyter`
2. Start Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
